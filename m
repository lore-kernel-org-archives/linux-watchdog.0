So, this is next-20140716?
I don't see the fixmap issue you're reporting, also not on the most rec=
ent next.

All I see is the known ext4 issue with CONFIG_SMP=3Dn:

fs/ext4/super.c: In function =91ext4_commit_super=92:
fs/ext4/super.c:4547:41: error: =91struct percpu_counter=92 has no memb=
er named =91counters=92
  if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_freeclusters_counter.counters)
                                         ^
fs/ext4/super.c:4551:39: error: =91struct percpu_counter=92 has no memb=
er named =91counters=92
  if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_freeinodes_counter.counters)
