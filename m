Don't know how this is handled for rtc drivers, but in other subsystems
we just live with the original name. I don't see a need to rename a driver
just because it starts supporting more hardware, and xxx is weird anyway
since it suggests everything from 000 to 999, which is much worse than
just sticking with 9063.
