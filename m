Any feedback on the 'powerdown' sysfs attribute that hooks to this
function? This allows the GSC to disable the board primary power
supply for 2^32 seconds and is often used to 'reset' the board
although it could also be used to put the board in a power down state
longer. I'm wondering if there is a more appropriate API for this in
the kernel that I don't know about.

I would also like to register a restart handler using this but I
believe that ARM restart handlers currently can not use I2C - is that
correct?

Regards,

Tim
