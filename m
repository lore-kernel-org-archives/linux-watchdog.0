In my opinion 10s is too long.

In this case we have precise start time when we should e.g. throttle
the CPU, because this interrupt will be fired by the hardware just
after the real temperature change. We do not have precise end time
for the throttling process, though. The function .get_temp
may return stale data which was read out some time ago
(< 3s or max 10s).
The hole system performance may suffer for too long (because the
temperature could drop to i.e. 100degC).

On the other hand, when we consider that this is just a binary flag
reacting on 125degC threshold then maybe there is a point of cooling
down the PMIC for longer time.
You are right it is application and system specific (i.e. how many
other temperature sensors is registered in the system and what
decisions we can make based on them i.e. in IPA).

Fair enough. You can mention about the throttling side effect so that
engineers working on bring-up will be aware of this particular knob
during the experiments.
