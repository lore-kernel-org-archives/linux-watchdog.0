Once the PRM/CM drivers and DT conversion is complete, this driver won't 
have any platform_data.  There won't be any watchdog driver initialization 
code in arch/arm/mach-omap2.  At that point in time, the driver will just 
call a function from the PRM driver that provides the reset source data.  

As you say, the watchdog can certainly do this from its probe code; it 
would be more efficient.  Just didn't want to make that change now; seems 
like it would be best done as a separate optimization patch.
