Yes, those two branches are required as the bare minimum.

I should've said runtime PM core for OMAP, by which I mean:

   http://marc.info/?l=linux-omap&m=128459521813724&w=2

That series has a dependency on only one of the patches from Greg's
queue you mentioned. Specifically, the one from me:

   driver core: platform_bus: allow runtime override of dev_pm_ops

which I also have in my pm-backports branch.

The only one that's currently ready is watchdog, and for that one I have
an Ack from Wim to merge this via linux-omap.

For the others that are close (UART, GPIO, i2c) I've asked that the next
versions of those be posted to LAKML as well as the subsystem lists.
>From there, I will ask the subsystem maintainers for an ack so we can
merge them via linux-omap along with all the platform changes.
