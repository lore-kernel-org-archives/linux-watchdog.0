So, we are on the same boat. For the HDMI issue, I also need visibility
to add any more ideas how to deal with it. Just provide me the binaries,
I see if I can at least reproduce the issue.

And I stopped discussing the pros and cons of the simple DT binding
as soon as I realized that my comments had no impact on the way it
will be implemented. I am not responsible for the binding.

...ranting at people not jumping into review and testing is.

Right. And since I am one of those volunteers, I can tell you that
some specific attitude in dealing with people is definitely reducing
the willingness to stick with it.

I constantly offered to spend my spare time for hunting the issue
but only received ranting.

Sure, nobody said that DT is feature complete. But you'd have to do
the same on mainline non-DT dove as there has never been support for
the cubox.

If it helps us tracking down the HDMI issue, we can have below setup
for DT dove and get rid of it incrementally.

I am sure, Andrew can drop removing mach-dove removal from the patches
and we can continue improving Dove mainline.
