The problem is that the picture appears for about a second, then goes black
for maybe a couple of seconds, then reappears for about a second and this
cycle repeats.  Rebooting into the DT kernel doesn't fix it.  Rebooting
back into the non-DT kernel does fix it.  Then if you boot back into the DT
kernel it's back again.  Boot back into the non-DT kernel and it's again
fixed.

I have compared register settings for the Si5351, LCD controllers and the
TDA998x between the non-DT and DT versions, and can find no differences
there.  Yet, DT kernels are the only kernels which exhibit this behaviour.
Non-DT kernels (which I've run continuously including many reboots) for
the last two years have *never* shown this problem.

I have also verified that the HDMI clock is correct.  The problem occurs
at both 1080p and 720p resolutions (which are the two that are used during
boot - I have the kernel using 720p, and Xorg uses 1080p.)

I should also point out that in both cases, it is the _same_ kernel binary
(3.15) that I'm running - the DT test case just has the DT blob attached
whereas the non-DT case boots without (and therefore falls back to the
old platform stuff.)
