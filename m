Thank you.

Agreed.
But, it should be useful in the case of an over-temperature in the system=
 PMIC=20
when the OS needs to be notified to bring core temperature under control.

Other components such as the ONKEY and Watchdog have not required the MFD
to be merged first. I don't see any strong dependency for the MFD to exis=
t with this
thermal component.

I'm not sure how much Lee is waiting for Acks to exist before proceeding =
with the MFD.
I have TO:'d Lee Jones, for this case.

Steve
