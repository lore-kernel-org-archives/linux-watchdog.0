I offered to deal with mainlining them end of April, you never replied.
I know that if you dislike something you answer, but it is hard to tell
if silence means agreement.

I am not going to waste any time preparing patches just to get a NAK.

If you are talking about "Kirkwood ASoC updates", you got a Tested-by
from Andrew even before I read your patches. And besides, just because
I am interested in Dove does not mean I just swallowed the whole Linux
API knowledge. I simply avoided commenting on it, because there is
/nothing/ I can add to it.

Really, I know you do dig down to the bottom of every subsystem you
are working with but I simply cannot. Just because I don't have the
time for it.

Oh, ok.. you think it is "me" and "us"? It is you who actually want to
use Dove and me just wanting a DT representation for it?

It is not my fault that your patches are blocked by others. I can offer
help to track down the issue, but I am not going to be your scapegoat.

Ok, let's have mach-dove for a little longer, fine with me.

What I really want is to stop that blackmailing with giving up on
sending patches. It will be a huge loss if you do and many have said
that in the past.

If it is really me who upsets you because you feel I am blocking your
patches, just ignore my comments. Jason will happily pick them up
just because you signed them off.
