It should be (I don't recall exactly what the logic is, but it's at
least half the watchdog time limit).

That depends on what we want.
If we want the watchdog to be inactive when entering suspend, then we
shouldn't reboot the machine when receiving a watchdog irq while the
system is suspended.
ITOH, with the hardware mode (reset handled by the watchdog IP) you
can't disable the watchdog when entering suspend, so I would expect the
same behavior for the SW mode.

I'm not sure, but IMO this interrupt should be flagged as NO_SUSPEND,
because it's here to reset the system (even if it is suspended).
If you flag the irq line as COND_SUSPEND, and atmel decide to give this
peripheral its own IRQ line (on new SoCs), then your watchdog will not
reboot the system when it is suspended.
Another solution would be to support wakeup for this peripheral and
delay the system reboot until it has resumed.

Anyway, if we decide to go for the wakeup approach, I'd prefer to post
another patch on top of this one.

Best Regards,

Boris
