Nope. That case will be 0x00020000

Read 0x1: Module is performing transition: wakeup, or
sleep, or sleep abortion
Read 0x2: Module is in idle mode (only INTRCONN part).
It is functional if using separate functional clock
Read 0x3: Module is disabled and cannot be accessed

Any module stuck in-transition will get the clock-domain from idle.

How is the interrupt related. You enable that when you enable WDT
petting using delay_interrupt()

If you look at the test case mentioned, the watchdong is started. Your
first observation is not as per the hardware behavior, so other points
becomes not relevant.
