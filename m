Thanks for the clarification.  I think we're on the same page. :)

Makes sense.

As of now, this bug doesn't exist in mainline because the hrtimer
deferral bits haven't landed yet, as you note below.

Yes, there is no functional difference in mainline currently between a
spin_lock_t and a raw_spin_lock_t.  There is also no
HRTIMER_MODE_REL_HARD like mentioned before.  These are
features/concepts currently only in the RT tree, but should be making
their way into mainline soon.

As far as path forward, I'd like to get some confirmation from Steffen
and/or Tim that the proposed patch fixes their issue, then I'll cook
some proper patches; the kthread_worker bits could go mainline now
because there is no dependency, but the watchdog change will need to be
RT-only for now.
