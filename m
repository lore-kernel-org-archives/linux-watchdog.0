Hi Eduardo,

Thank you for your review comments,

Ah, yes. I did not discuss that part in the design. Looking at this objec=
tively, it is not
immediately obvious -- although you did describe my intentions exactly. I=
 will add
those two changes into the next PATCH V5 submission so the meaning is exp=
licit.

As of writing this reply, the latest available datasheet for DA9062 conta=
ins
sections on "Absolute Maximum Ratings" and "Recommended Operating Conditi=
ons"
for the junction temperature.

Regarding the warning temperature the datasheet says, "Operating the devi=
ce in
conditions exceeding [this level] [...] for extended periods of time may
affect device reliability".

Reference to the documentation in the Linux kernel would also be useful o=
n
the warning threshold. The driver defines this trip-point as,

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt
"hot": A trip point to notify emergency

I chose this trip point to indicate a strong recommendation that the
temperature warning is treated as an emergency, and should be brought und=
er
control as fast as possible. This will stop any potential reliability pro=
blems before
the hardware enforces "a shutdown sequence to RESET mode" in the PMIC.

I'm not certain what failsafe capability the general driver "should" have=
.
I am not implementing a notify function for instance. I expect the genera=
l
driver to be modified by the designers of the final integrated system. Th=
ey
will also have access to the PMIC product datasheet and the information o=
n
over-temperature and would be best placed to make a decision for their
system.

Thank you for your additional explanation.

I will implement this as part of the next PATCH V5 submission.

I agree. If I can possibly avoid creating device specific properties that=
 are not
required and instead re-use existing core ones, I should do that.
