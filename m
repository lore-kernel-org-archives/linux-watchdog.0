Yeah, that's why I'm setting the RTC/RTT in the pm_enter() callback on=20
our products. On wake-up I'm checking if we woke up using the RTC/RTT in=20
the pm_suspend_again() callback, if true we clear the watchdog and we go=20
back to sleep. This can't easily be mainlined because it adds=20
RTC/RTT/WDT calls from PM code, which will not be accepted anyway.

I agree, but it still can't be stopped, IMHO users wanting to suspend=20
without being protected by the watchdog during suspend and resume should=20
just don't use the hardware watchdog at all, they are already missing=20
the watchdog in a tricky area where the kernel can fail more than=20
anywhere else, the software watchdog should be fine as well for them.
