These above two commits are trying very hard to ensure timely wakeup and
execution of the watchdogd thread.  First by moving moving to kthread
delayed work, and secondly to vanilla kthread work + hardirq.

This is sufficient on mainline, because hardirq expiry fns are
unconditionally executed in hardirq context.  With PREEMPT_RT_FULL,
however, the hrtimer expiry functions are executed in softirq context
unless explicitly opted out.

...meaning that w/ PREEMPT_RT_FULL the expiry (and therefore the
watchdogd wakeup) may be indefinitely starved if there are runnable RT
tasks of higher priority than the softirq callback thread (ktimersoftd @
SCHED_FIFO 1 by default).

This is an inversion.

One possible solution is to opt-out of the hrtimer softirq deferral by
making use of the HRTIMER_MODE_HARD, however, the expiry function will
need to be vetted for use in hardirq context w/ PREEMPT_RT_FULL.  From a
cursory glance at the kthread_worker locking, it is not hardirq safe. :-\
