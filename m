Russell,

we all know about the pain to get things into mainline especially when
it touches different sub-systems. That is why I was asking for /your/
plans, so we can think of ways to deal with mach-dove removal and your
pending patches.

Of course we thought about it. But as you are dealing with different
SoCs at a time, we also have to care about some more SoCs than just
Dove. And, of course, we also run out of spare time to prepare proper
patches over and over again. I really /know/ that if you send patches,
they are well thought and well tested, so I basically postpone work
on that if I know you are working on it.

My current idea of PMU register space is to have a DT provided regmap
but again, there are patches floating around but currently that regmap
helpers are still WIP. FWIW, if you look at dove pinctrl, we did a
last-minute patch for the PMU regs - just because you mentioned a
concern, so we really care about your opinion. The fact that it is not
solved is pure lack of time.

Exactly that increasing amount of (valuable) patches makes it more
and more difficult for you and us to reproduce any issues. All I am
asking for is: if you don't push that branch for good reason, try to
split off at least some patches. Hunting issues like the HDMI thing
with 250 patches off, really isn't going to work well.

Nobody wants you to revert any cubox patches! Honestly, I repeatedly
said that /although/ I cannot reproduce the issue on my (mainline)
branch, I still /agree/ that there may be issues. But as long as I
cannot reproduce it, I cannot dig into it.

To put it another way: "Especially for me DT does work properly here
and non-DT does not". Let's just try to reduce the gap between mainline
and your branch incrementally.

I didn't say I *know* it is 'timing', but neither I do buy "it's because
of DT". I said it may be related with init order and ignoring clock
stable requirements. I've written Si5351 driver from an Application
Note that is not very noisy about dynamic configuration, there are no
checks for stable clocks at all.

Anyway, I still offer my time to hunt the HDMI issue: If we agree on
some way to share your code or you provide some binaries I can reproduce
the issue with, it will be a small step forward.
