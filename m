Yes, for me it is. The driver is still the same, and I don't see the point
of increasing code size and making the driver less readable just to be able
to report a slightly different driver identification string. And each time
a similar HW is added we would go through the same effort, again for no good
reason.

FWIW the driver doesn't really need to be updated in the first place.
A compatible statement listing both da9061 and da9062 would do it. Plus,
on top of that, even your change would not guarantee that the output is correct.
A DT entry with lists da9061 compatibility on a da9062 system would report the
"wrong" name. And still work. So I really don't see the point.
