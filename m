Right.  I forgot about that part.

Right.  "Suspended state" meaning full suspend here I suppose?

That's correct.  IRQF_NO_SUSPEND does not guarantee that interrupts from
that IRQ will have any effect after arch_suspend_disable_irqs() in
suspend_enter().

That's correct too.

We can't guarantee that, though.  arch_suspend_disable_irqs() disables
interrupts on the last working CPU and it won't get any.  It may be
brought out of a low-power state by a pending interrupt, but it won't act
upon that interrupt immediately anyway, only after the arch_suspend_enable_irqs()
in suspend_enter().  But then it might as well be deferred until after
resume_device_irqs().
