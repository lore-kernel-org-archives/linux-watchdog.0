The Atmel watchdog can't be stopped once it's started. This is actually=20
very useful so we can reset if suspend or resume failed, the only=20
drawback is that you have to wake up from time to time (e.g. by using=20
the RTC/RTT) to clear the watchdog and then go back to sleep ASAP.

I am working on safety products and keeping the watchdog running=20
whatever the state is almost mandatory, one of the test on those=20
products is about unsoldering all the crystals live from your product=20
and the product should detect the general fault and power on a buzzer=20
and a yellow fault LED. This is usually done with a watchdog clocked=20
=66rom an internal RC of the =C2=B5C/SoC (so it can't be unsoldered ;-) and=
 a=20
GPIO with a reset state in input/pull-up, the device clamps the GPIO to=20
ground, if the watchdog resets the system the GPIO is going to switch=20
back to input therefore changing its state.

This can of course be done with an external watchdog circuitry, but it=20
costs more and will consume much more than using =C3=A0 1 =C2=B5A RC=20
oscillator/watchdog already present in the =C2=B5C/SoC.
