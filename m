CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE means that we have a DC21285 in the system.  We
used to have ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE and ARCH_CO285 which both selected
CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE.

ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE was for either host or addin mode using a PAGE_OFFSET
of 0xc0000000.  ARCH_CO285 had a PAGE_OFFSET of 0x80000000 as they
wanted to be able to map almost all of PCI memory space.

So think of CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE as meaning that we have the physical
device, and CONFIG_ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE meaning that we want to support
boards with the device on.

So, it may make sense to rename CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE to CONFIG_DC21285
if that makes the configuration symbol intention clearer.

This is why I prefer even hidden symbols to have a help text - having
the help text explains why they exist...
