In the new watchdog core code, each watchdog driver gets a separate 
/dev/watchdog* character device.  The ioctls are called on those device 
nodes.

[ As an aside, neither the OMAP watchdog driver, nor the TWL watchdog 
driver have been updated to use the new watchdog core code.  So they both 
can't be loaded at the same time until one or both are fixed. ]

Sounds like a question better asked of Alan Cox and Wim, who wrote the 
watchdog core code.

Two other observations:

- It's possible that two different watchdogs could report different boot 
reasons.  The TWL might store its own watchdog boot reason which could be 
different from what's reported via the OMAP PRM.  For example, the TWL can 
record a thermal shutdown reset event, STS_BOOT.TS, which wouldn't be 
reflected in the PRM reset source data, which would just see some kind of 
external reset or power-off event.

- The PRM doesn't contain a hardware watchdog, so not sure it makes sense 
to create a watchdog driver for it.
