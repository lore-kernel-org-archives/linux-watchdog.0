I'm not sure I understand the whole discussion, but calling
enable_irq_wake() does affect suspend behavior on at91 platforms.
Take a look at the suspend() implementation [1], it's making use of the
wake_active field (modified by irq_gc_set_wake) when entering suspend
in order to keep wakeup IRQ sources enabled.

Boris
