What I can do is provide a branch of all the current stuff which is
relatively clean for mainline:

http://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/cgit/linux-cubox.git/log/?h=cubox-ml-3.15

there's lots missing from it, and it probably doesn't even build
properly, but that's one of the side effects of trying to keep
everything working and juggling between mainline and something that
works.

All that I'm /complaining/ about is the very quick removal of the
non-DT support.

Indeed, but successively merging mainline into Rabeeh's tree is rather
trivial for the most part (apart from a few nasty conflicts, such as the
completely different si5531 driver).  Where that happens, I take
mainline's version, and if necessary augment it to make non-DT work
again.

That has pros and cons - the pro is that I get to keep a feature complete
kernel on the hardware.  The con is that I still need to use bits of
mach-dove to make everything work, even with DT.

Right, and you'll also need stuff such as the component updates I've
been trying to push recently, updates to Armada DRM so that it can be
used in a DT environment (included in the above git tree), and probably
a few other things.

The timeline for DRM stuff looks something like this:

- get the component updates reviewed and acceptable
- get those merged by Greg
- chase up what's happening with the DRM bug fix
- get the DRM of_graph helper reviewed and merged
- get the Armada DRM component helper conversion reviewed and merged
  (which depends on sorting out how to deal with the component helper
   dependency and need for those changes to be with these changes.)
- same for the tda998x driver, which will also need the DRM of_graph
  helpers.

I /suspect/ what's going to happen there is that the component updates
will make the 3.17 merge window, and maybe the initial DRM stuff.
The remainder will be for the 3.18 merge window when everyone has
the dependencies in their trees to cope with those changes.

So that's probably something like 4 to 6 months just for that (assuming
a kernel cycle is three months.)
