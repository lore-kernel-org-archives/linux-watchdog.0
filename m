Sorry. Let me try again.
The problem I observe, is that the watchdog is trigged, because it doesn't get pinged.
The ksoftirqd seems to be blocked although it runs at a much higher priority than the
blocking userspace task.

I don't know, if it ever worked or not. This is the first kernel version I tried.
According to the two commits mentioned, I assume that it won't work in older versions.

In my test case, the device is not open. It gets started by the bootloader and than is
running. I tried opening the device after it was already running, but it does not make
a difference. If the watchdog is put into running state by opening it from userspace,
the bug does not occur. If the bootloader starts it and the kernel just continues pinging
the watchdog, it does occur, open or not.

> - What is the configured watchdog timeout (both from BIOS/ROMMON and in Linux) ?

The watchdog is configured to a timeout of 5 seconds, both in bootloader and kernel.
The dw_wdt driver will round it to the nearest value it supports. Higher values do not make
the bug go away.


Thanks,
