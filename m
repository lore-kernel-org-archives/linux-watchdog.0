I expected something like that. Is it possible to "have" the device on =
a
cpu !=3D StrongARM? If so I wonder why ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE is a "ARM system
type". And if not, wouldn't it be possible and better to have all
platforms which select CPU_SA110 (ARCH_EBSA110, ARCH_FOOTBRIDGE; what
about RPC?) in a single mach dir and make FOOTBRIDGE an option there?

It's hard to find information on the net about these chips, even
http://developer.intel.com/design/strong/sa110.htm only talks about x86
stuff only, so please excuse my unknowingness.

Maybe even better CONFIG_HAS_DC21285?

Best regards
