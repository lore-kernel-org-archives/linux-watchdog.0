There is actually a cubox regression which has yet to be tracked down.
Running with my kernel (which is not-DT based) runs perfectly.  With
DT, HDMI output can be unstable.

One of the problems is that it's /very/ difficult to reproduce, but it
is reproducable.  I've seen it on two days over many reboots, and I've
proved it by switching back and forth.  DT sometimes suffers from the
problem, whereas non-DT /never/ does.

Sebastian is aware of this, and as yet we haven't found a solution,
nor have we found a way to reliably reproduce it.
