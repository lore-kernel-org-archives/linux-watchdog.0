>=20

Quite warm.
I got this from the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt
	"hot":		A trip point to notify emergency
	"critical":	Hardware not reliable.

The junction temperature supervision characteristics for DA9061 supports th=
ree
levels and 125degC is the lowest "warning" level.  This warning level is in=
tended
for non-invasive temperature control where the necessary mitigation is unde=
r
software control of the system.

The other two levels are hotter than 125degC and it is not possible to inte=
rvene
using software. The hardware will automatically power off.

There is nothing to do in the device driver. This is just a stub for board =
specific additions
to mitigate the temperature. There is a similar function in the  RCAR therm=
al driver which
contains a FIXME comment. But, apart from helping with my testing, it doesn=
't add
anything in the driver. It can be removed.

Yes.
This was a comment for the watchdog device driver as well. My concern was h=
aving=20
multiple devices (61 and 62) in the same system -- and allowing the driver =
to report=20
the hardware difference.

There is discussion going on about this in other threads. Not certain of th=
e final outcome
yet, apart from my existing proposal should be changed.

I will take a look at this for V2.
