Hi Guenter,

Ok. I see now.=20

It's not a mandatory interrupt and so it should not fail the whole driver u=
pon an error from
the devm_request_threaded_irq() request ... I will let it pass through if t=
here is a problem and
just display a debug message. Something like this:

I think I've understood now. I guess this is it..
I'll send a PATCH V3 with this change.
