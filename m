I am aware of the issue but have not been able to reproduce it. Also,
we have no /official/ non-DT CuBox support in mainline Linux at all.
I understand that removing non-DT mach-dove currently is not your
most preferred patch but from a mainline POV, mach-dove isn't actively
used. The three officially supported boards have been converted to DT
months ago and haven't received any TLC since then, so I doubt they are
used by anyone.

My current impression of the issue is that it is more related with
driver load order/missing delays for clocks/ignoring IP behavior on
clock rate change or something like it.

Can you give a /rough/ schedule for your plans to sort out your private
branches? If we can all investigate the issue with the same code basis,
I am sure we can make DT dove behave the same way non-DT dove seems to
be.
