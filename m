I find your e-mail confusing, sorry. The subject says that the watchdog is not
triggering, the description says that it is triggering when it should not.

You also provide no information if the watchdog is active (open from user space)
or not. There is some indication in "This only happens if the watchdog is already
enabled on boot" but that isn't really precise - it may be enabled on boot but still
open. On top of that, your e-mail suggests that the problem may be a regression,
since you refer to a specific kernel release, yet you provide no information if
the very same test worked with a different kernel version, or what that kernel
version would be.

Please not only describe what you are doing, but also provide the complete context.
Specifically,
- Did this ever work ? If yes, what are working kernel versions ?
- Is the watchdog device open ?
- Does it make a difference if it is ?
- What is the configured watchdog timeout (both from BIOS/ROMMON and in Linux) ?

Thanks,
Guenter
