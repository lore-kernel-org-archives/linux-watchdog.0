Extend existing DA9062 binding information to include the DA9061 PMIC for
MFD core and regulators.

Add a da9062-onkey link to the existing onkey binding file.

Add a da9062-thermal link to the new temperature monitoring binding file.

Delete the da9062-watchdog section and replace it with a link to the new
DA9061/62 binding information file.

This patch applies against linux-next and v4.11-rc3

v5 -> v6
 - NO CODE CHANGE
 - Rebased from v4.9 to v4.11-rc3

v4 -> v5
 - NO CODE CHANGE
 - Rebased from v4.8 to v4.9

v3 -> v4
 - Patch renamed from [PATCH V3 4/9] to [PATCH V4 3/8]
 - Remove double newline spacing in text file
 - Added Acked-by Rob Herring

v2 -> v3
 - Patch renamed from [PATCH V2 04/10] to [PATCH V3 4/9]
 - Ensure binding description concentrates on the device not the
   device driver
 - Separate the DA9061 and DA9062 sub-device tables to distinguish
   the difference between the two devices
 - Update the commit message to describe this change
 - Add e-mail information about associated patches from this set
   without describing them as being explicitly dependent on this
   binding

v1 -> v2
 - Patch renamed from [PATCH V1 09/10] to [PATCH V2 04/10] -- these
   changes were made to fix checkpatch warnings caused by the patch
   set dependency order

Hi,

Added an Ack from Rob Herring for the PATCH V3 version.

As previously:
Other information:
The device driver from this patch set (associated with this binding) is

- [PATCH V5 4/8] mfd: da9061: MFD core support

and also the following binding file changes:

- Binding for onkey (already applied by Dmitry Torokhov)
- [PATCH V5 1/8] Binding for watchdog
- [PATCH V5 2/8] Binding for thermal

Regards,
Steve Twiss, Dialog Semiconductor
