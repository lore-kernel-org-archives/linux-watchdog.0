Thanks for getting me up to speed.

Understood. My original concern was if the driver would be too nice with
the event. But given that the hardware has its own shutdown protection,
looks like we are OK here.

OK. got it. Then, I am assuming your strategy here is to keep periodically issuing uevents
(HOT trip point) to userland, hoping that something would change the
system power consumption, then, relying on the hardware shutdown protection
if nothing happens.

I would say, your above explanation, and the uevent based strategy,
deserves to be at least in the commit message, preferably in the driver
documentation, so people know what to expect from the driver.

Now, if my understand is correct, would it make sense to have still a
failsafe mechanism in the driver? Maybe having a max number of polling?

The data sheet does not mention anything, but does one have any silicon
lifetime implication if one leaves the PMIC running for very long time
in a temperature between Twarn and Tcrit?

my point was more under the lines of having this driver using the
of-thermal DT support to get the polling value, instead of you having a
manufacturer specific property:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt

But given that your case is more specific, I start to see why you
avoided using it. But still, you could probably get the polling
values from of-thermal, populated in the tz struct, then using them from
the tz, when handling the IRQ event.

Probably your regular polling should always be set to 0, and the passive
polling to the value you want.

then again, this comment is more from a DT perspective than from the
driver code itself. Just trying to avoid specific properties that may
get described by what is already defined.
