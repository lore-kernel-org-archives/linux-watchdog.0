I didn't get my point across either. Problem is that your driver fails to load
if the interrupt is not there. With the interrupt really being optional, I don't
see the point in making it mandatory just to display a message if it fires.

Never a good argument to make with me. 100 people doing something wrong
doesn't mean you should continue to do so.
