Yes, the HW bug that we address in these functions:
at91sam9260_restart() and at91sam9g45_restart().

We have this issue because of NAND flash lines shared with DDR that are
driven during product reboot on old products (Cf. these functions
comments). This bug would kick-in when doing "software reset"/"watchdog
reset"/"push button reset". Only the "software reset" is handled by the
functions above.

So, yes, this "software watchdog" is there for this purpose IIRC.
