The watchdog interrupt handler is not here to ping the watchdog, it's
here to reset the platform if the watchdog hasn't been refreshed
appropriately.

IOW, it's a software watchdog using at91 WDT capabilities to determine
when it should reboot the system.
IIRC, we need this on some at91 platforms to fix a HW bug (maybe
Nicolas can confirm this).
