One thing you could try would be to return NULL (or where appropriate
an error) in the #else case of CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM and CONFIG_HAS_IOPORT,
ie dont take COMPILE_TEST into account at all. Obviously that means
you won't be able to dump a warning message in the COMPILE_TEST
case, but at least the code would compile. The rejection of above patch
would make a good case for this approach.
