That's because I am quite prepared to work on them _if_ there is a way
forward.  You've already said that changing things like hwmon and rtc
is a work in progress to convert them to regmap.  That's great, but
in order to progress these myself, I need *visibility* of that work,
and there is zero visibility of that.

No I am not - and those are the patches which I referred to as having
been already taken by Mark into his tree.  The patch I'm referring to
which can never be merged now is the one which I replied to Jean
Francois just now - and if you read through it, you'll understand
why - that's because it /totally/ breaks the simple DT bindings that
are now established - independently - for Kirkwood stuff.

Right, and removing the non-DT support and screwing people like me
who have out of tree patches is good for MVEBU development because...
(complete the sentence with a damned good reason.)

Great, that's all I ask.  I'm trying as fast as I can to push stuff
out - I'm not being anywhere close to idle about it - but it takes time
to deal with the updates from each merge window and such like, work out
what has been accepted, which patches need to be revised, and do all the
testing that's necessary before trying to get some more out.  Oh, and
port some more of the patches over to be mainline-based.

I would've preferred to be clear of the ASoC stuff 12 months ago, and
we all know why that was a big problem.

It's not blackmail.  It's reality.  If the kernel becomes too much
hassle to deal with, then volunteers will walk away from it - that's
almost a fact of life.

Even with DT support, I'm nowhere near being "DT clean" on the Cubox -
I need this as a minimum to do "special" stuff there:
