Are you sure about that ? The other email seemed to suggest that the userspace
task is running at higher priority.

The big question here is if the watchdog daemon that keeps the watchdog open is
running at higher priority than the userspace task taking all available CPU
time.

If the watchdog daemon runs at lower priority, the observed behavior would be
as expected.

Overall, we have a number possibilities to consider:

- The kernel watchdog timer thread is not triggered at all under some
  circumstances, meaning it is not set properly. So far we have no real
  indication that this is the case (since the code works fine unless some
  userspace task takes all available CPU time).
- The watchdog device is closed. The kernel watchdog timer thread is
  starved and does not get to run. The question is what to do in this
  situation. In a real time system, this is almost always a fatal
  condition. Should the system really be kept alive in this situation ?
- The watchdog device is open.
  - The watchdog daemon runs at higher priority than the process taking
    all CPU time. Everything should work as expected.
  - The watchdog daemon runs at the same or at a lower priority than
    the process taking all CPU time. I would argue that, in this case,
    everything is also working as expected: The watchdog daemon is starved,
    does not get to run, and the system resets because, per its configuration,
    it is in bad shape.

Overall, the only real possible problem would be if the watchdog thread
in the kernel does not run because of some bug, and that it is not really
starved. We would probably have to instrument the kernel to find out if
this is the case, unless someone has a better idea.

Am I missing something ?

Thanks,
Guenter
