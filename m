Hi Tony,

This series is based on my pm-core branch which is basically the the
stuff I have submitted upstream (my pm-next series, the runtime PM core)
and a collection of hwmod fixes that Paul/Benoit have lined up
for 2.6.37.

I will gladly queue these hwmod conversion patches in my tree if you
prefer since I am already managing all the dependencies.

Kevin
