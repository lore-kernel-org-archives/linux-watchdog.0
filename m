So question is if we need a separate interrupt handler for that, expecially
since it is shared with the PIT timer anyway.

Seems to me that the simplest way out of this conundrum would be to simply
make the timer's interrupt handler kick the watchdog every once a while and
get rid of the separate watchdog interrupt handler entirely.

While at it, can anyone explain to me please how the suspend state (full
suspend) looks like on that platform?  What's different from the working
state in particular.
