enable_irq_wake() has no effect on IRQF_NO_SUSPEND interrupts, so if the
driver uses IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, it does not need to use enable_irq_wake()
in addition to that.

Drivers using IRQF_COND_SUSPEND generally should use enable_irq_wake() too
in case they end up in a situation without sharing a NO_SUSPEND interrupt, in
which case their interrupt handlers won't be called after suspend_device_irqs(),
so they need to rely on the core to do the wakeup.

It depends on whether or not the watchdog's interrupt handler has to be
called immediately after receiving an interrupt (IRQF_NO_SUSPEND is
better then) or it can be deferred till the resume_device_irqs() time.
