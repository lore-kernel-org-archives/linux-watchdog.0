Nothing has changed on the PMU patches since I posted them, because
they're based on 3.15 and there's been no changes there.

Right, so what I have against mainline right now in my tree is:

* two SPI patches, which have been taken by Mark
* one long term core ARM patch adding optimised memset/memcpy IO operations
* the PMU stuff
* BMM (already published in git form)
* Vmeta (already published in git form)
* ASoC cleanup patches, which Mark took last week.

What isn't visible is the stuff which converts Armada DRM to component
support, along with the TDA998x driver (and it sounds like the TI LCDC
people may end up blocking that effort).  This is necessary to convert
it to DT support.  However, this depends on the component helper, and
that's where there's a blocking problem.

I sent out a bunch of patches last week, with a request for help from
the Exynos people.  So far, that has only attracted one relatively minor
comment from the iMX people.  I can't move forwards with the Armada
DRM until this is sorted.  Neither can I move forward with the TDA998x
driver.

As for the ASoC stuff which you avoided commenting on, let me repeat
that _that_ stuff is now totally dead and can /never/ be merged into
mainline without breaking the existing ASoC kirkwood support.  In
that case, it's not like I wasn't sending the patches out, because
I had been... so everyone was aware of what was going on there,
but I guess converting stuff to DT in ways that totally fuck over
other patches is what now happens in the kernel.

What I think you're missing is that for those of us who want to have
a platform fully supported, the choice has been non-DT until relatively
recently.  We're now at the point where the DT support on Dove has
matured to the point where it's relatively easy to end up with a fully
functional (but not necessarily bug free) setup with DT.  It's at the
sweet spot where you can switch between DT and non-DT and preserve
that functionality... but as soon as we get there we want to rip out
the old stuff.

Let me put that another way: it's at the point where those of us who
have been using non-DT support can start moving the remaining drivers
over to a DT environment without any functional loss.

What I'm trying to get you to understand is that leaving the old stuff
behind for a little while longer is beneficial - while those who have
been running crippled DT based setups for the last year don't care
about having full support, there are those who do.

Of course, there's another solution to this.  I stay with my present
3.15 kernel for ever.  That basically bars me from sending any further
patches.  It also means that I stop maintaining TDA998x and Armada DRM,
and you will have to take those over, which means you get the additional
workload from those.  Is that what you really want?

The Cubox is the /only/ ARM platform I have which is a capable media
player, and I'm trying not to have it screwed by this kind of crap.
